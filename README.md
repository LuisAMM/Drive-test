# Abstract

A Drive Test system is one that is responsible for carrying out radio frequency measurements to verify the status of a cellular network. In the present work, a Drive Test system is implemented that is based on the GSM SIM900 module and the XM37-1612 GPS, where the D1 mini development board is used for its control and configuration. To do this, the characteristics of these devices are studied, the different AT commands that the GSM module has are compared and finally a system proposal based on previous studies is presented. A C ++ library was created to implement the proposed system, and a test run was carried out that measured signal level, the number and location of missed calls, the quality of the calls made, the absolute radio frequency number of the channel. control code, the country code, the network code, the base station identity code, the cell identifier, the minimum level of access to the cell, the maximum transmission power of the mobile, the code location area, time advance, and bit error rate. The results obtained from the tour showed that with the proposed system it is feasible to implement a simple Drive Test system, due to the lack of functionalities of a complete Drive Test.
